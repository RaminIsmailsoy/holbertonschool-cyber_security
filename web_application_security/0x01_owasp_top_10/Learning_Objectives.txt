1. What is the OWASP Top 10?

https://owasp.org/Top10/2025/
The Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP) is an open community dedicated to enabling organizations to develop, purchase, and maintain applications and APIs that can be trusted.
The OWASP Foundation is the non-profit entity that ensures the project's long-term success. Almost everyone associated with OWASP is a volunteer, including the OWASP board, chapter leaders, project leaders, and project members. We support innovative security research with grants and infrastructure.


2. Why is injection dangerous?


Injection flaws happen when untrusted data (such as user input) is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query. Attackers can manipulate the input so that the system executes unintended commands, accessing, modifying, or deleting data—and even gaining control of the server.


3. How does XSS affect web applications?
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) allows attackers to inject malicious scripts (usually JavaScript) into web pages viewed by other users. It affects web apps by enabling attackers to:

Steal cookies and session tokens
Hijack user accounts
Deliver phishing or malware
Redirect users to malicious sites
This happens when untrusted data is included in a page without properly validating or escaping it.



4. What is the risk of broken authentication?

Broken authentication occurs when login and session mechanisms are insecure. Risks include:
Accounts being hijacked due to weak passwords or session tokens
Attackers assuming other users’ identities
Bypassing multi-factor authentication or credential checks
Flaws such as missing lockout controls, predictable session IDs, and insecure password storage significantly increase the likelihood of unauthorized access.
