1. What is the OWASP Top 10?

https://owasp.org/Top10/2025/
The Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP) is an open community dedicated to enabling organizations to develop, purchase, and maintain applications and APIs that can be trusted.
The OWASP Foundation is the non-profit entity that ensures the project's long-term success. Almost everyone associated with OWASP is a volunteer, including the OWASP board, chapter leaders, project leaders, and project members. We support innovative security research with grants and infrastructure.


2. Why is injection dangerous?


Injection flaws happen when untrusted data (such as user input) is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query. Attackers can manipulate the input so that the system executes unintended commands, accessing, modifying, or deleting data—and even gaining control of the server.


3. How does XSS affect web applications?
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) allows attackers to inject malicious scripts (usually JavaScript) into web pages viewed by other users. It affects web apps by enabling attackers to:

Steal cookies and session tokens
Hijack user accounts
Deliver phishing or malware
Redirect users to malicious sites
This happens when untrusted data is included in a page without properly validating or escaping it.



4. What is the risk of broken authentication?

Broken authentication occurs when login and session mechanisms are insecure. Risks include:
Accounts being hijacked due to weak passwords or session tokens
Attackers assuming other users’ identities
Bypassing multi-factor authentication or credential checks
Flaws such as missing lockout controls, predictable session IDs, and insecure password storage significantly increase the likelihood of unauthorized access.


5. Can you explain sensitive data exposure?

Sensitive data exposure refers to failure to properly protect confidential information—like passwords, credit card numbers, or personal data. If encryption is weak or missing, data can be stolen or modified during storage or transmission.
Key protections:
Strong encryption for data at rest and in transit
Proper handling of keys and sensitive fields
Minimizing retention of unnecessary sensitive information
Exposure increases risk of identity theft, fraud, and legal compliance failures.



6. Describe a security misconfiguration.

A security misconfiguration occurs when systems or applications are left in an insecure state—such as:
Default accounts or passwords not changed
Outdated software or unpatched systems
Insecure security settings (e.g., open ports, verbose error messages)
These mistakes leave systems open to exploitation because attackers can find weak points easily.


7. What is XML External Entity (XXE)?

XML External Entity (XXE) is a vulnerability that arises when an XML parser processes untrusted XML input and the attacker defines external entities. It can allow attackers to:
Access internal server files
Make internal network requests
Cause denial of service
Execute malicious actions
It typically occurs in poorly configured or outdated XML parsers.


8. How do broken access controls impact security?

Broken access control means the system does not properly enforce who can access what. An attacker can:
Access or modify other users’ data
Escalate privileges (e.g., from user to admin)
Perform unauthorized actions
This undermines trust boundaries and violates the principle of least privilege.


9. What are common web application security flaws?

Aside from injection and XSS, common flaws include:
Broken authentication and session management
Sensitive data exposure
Security misconfiguration
Insecure deserialization
Using vulnerable or outdated components
Insufficient logging and monitoring
These are the recurring top risks seen across apps.

10. How to prevent Insecure Deserialization?

To prevent insecure deserialization—where attackers send manipulated serialized objects that execute unintended actions—developers should:
Avoid accepting serialized data from untrusted sources
Validate and sanitize input carefully
Use safe serialization formats or libraries
Apply integrity checks (signatures) before deserialization
This mitigates remote code execution and other attacks.


11. What is the use of security logging and monitoring?

Security logging and monitoring helps detect attacks early. Without logs or alerting, breaches may go unnoticed for months, allowing attackers to dig deeper, pivot to other systems, or cause more damage.
Proper logging supports incident response and forensic analysis.


12. Explain the risks of using components with known vulnerabilities.

Using third-party components (libraries, plugins, frameworks) that have known security issues is risky because attackers can exploit those weaknesses to:
Gain unauthorized access
Compromise data or server
Escalate privileges
Even if your own code is secure, vulnerable dependencies open up attack avenues.


13. How can using APIs increase security risks?

APIs expand the attack surface because they:
Expose backend logic and data to clients
Often lack proper authentication or rate limits
Can expose sensitive operations that aren’t intended for general use
APIs must be secured with authentication, authorization, input validation, and rate limiting to prevent abuse. APIs that aren’t properly secured become a gateway for attackers to access internal data and services. (General security practice)
